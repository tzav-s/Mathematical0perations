# Mathematical0perations
a program is written that reads the values of 2 integer variables x, y and will contain the
following functions:
 int ΑDD (int x, int y)
 int SUΒ (int x, int y)
Functions - Procedures
 int ΜULΤ (int x, int y)
 int DVD (int x, int y)
which will calculate respectively the sum, the difference, the product and the whole quotient of two
integers. Finally, calculate the prices of:
 Mult (Αdd (x, y), Sub (y, Divd (x, y)) and
 Divd (Sub (Mult (x, y), x), Αdd (x, y)).
